Creating the project
++++++++++++++++++++

Generating the necessary files
------------------------------

From the command line, cd into a directory where 
youâ€™d like to store your code, then run the following 
command : ::
 >> django-admin startproject auctionsonline

This will create a directory named auctionsonline in your 
current directory.

If we look at the directory we created::

 mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py

This files are:

* ``manage.py`` : A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. We will use this file a lot.

* ``settings.py`` : Settings/configuration for this Django project.

* ``urls.py`` : The URL declarations for this Django project.

* ``__init__.py`` : An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

* ``wsgi.py`` : An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project

Testing the Django Project 
--------------------------

To verify if the django project works run the following 
command : ::
 >> python manage.py runserver

We should see the following output : ::
